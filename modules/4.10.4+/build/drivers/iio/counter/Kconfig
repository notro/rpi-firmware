	  Say yes here to build support for the ACCES 104-QUAD-8 quadrature
	  encoder counter/interface device family (104-QUAD-8, 104-QUAD-4).

	  Performing a write to a counter's IIO_CHAN_INFO_RAW sets the counter and
	  also clears the counter's respective error flag. Although the counters
	  have a 25-bit range, only the lower 24 bits may be set, either directly
	  or via a counter's preset attribute. Interrupts are not supported by
	  this driver.

	  The base port addresses for the devices may be configured via the base
	  array module parameter.
