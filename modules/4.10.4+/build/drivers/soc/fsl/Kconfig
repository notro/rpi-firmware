	  The global utilities block controls power management, I/O device
	  enabling, power-onreset(POR) configuration monitoring, alternate
	  function selection for multiplexed signals,and clock control.
	  This driver is to manage and access global utilities block.
	  Initially only reading SVR and registering soc device are supported.
	  Other guts accesses, such as reading RCW, should eventually be moved
	  into this driver as well.
